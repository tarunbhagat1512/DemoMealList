# DemoMealList

- Code Structure Used : MVVM

- Used Table View for listing the item

- Inside the table View Used Scroll view for listing thi ingeridiant

- Api Call has been performed by single Request function 
to call the Api i had used URLSession

- for loading the image i had used SDWebImage Pod

- Also Attached Video of the application run inside the Project Folder only.


- Due to less time i was not able to load the data of the Ingeridiant Was planning to load by Stack View and whenever i find the ingridian blank then that view should not be shown or been hidden as stack view contains the space as per the size of the view
